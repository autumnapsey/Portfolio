			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Hello! My name is Autumn Apsey. I've lived my whole life in the Metro-Detroit area and am looking forward to making a career change into web development. Currently I am in a front end web development bootcamp at <a href="http://grandcircus.co">Grand Circus</a>. While I'm not learning to code I enjoy binging on Netflix and nachos. I love to travel and learn about other cultures. I spend as much time as I can volunteering as a leader with <a href="http://www.cisvusa.org/">CISV</a>, specifically its Detroit chapter.</p>
			<p>I am learning the skills to be a front end web developer currently. Once I decide on anything specific that I am interested in within that, I will put information on what my specialized interests are here. For now I am looking forward to getting the basics down.
